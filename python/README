# installation from source

Quickest way (works on Ubuntu 18.04 or higher with ansible playbook version 2.5 or higher):

> mkdir src
> cd src
> git clone <repo>
> ansible-playbook comma/system/ansible/install.yml --ask-become-pass

Manual way:

> mkdir -p src build/comma
> cd src
> git clone https://gitlab.com/orthographic/comma
> cd ../build/comma
> cmake ../../src/comma
> make
> sudo make install

Read install.yml, if interested in tweaking build configuration.
