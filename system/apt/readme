to build docker that has ansible, cmake, etc, run (you may need to run as sudo - am not sure why; try without sudo first):

> ./comma-apt-docker-build 18.04 # ubuntu 18.04
> ./comma-apt-docker-build 20.04 # ubuntu 20.04

to build deb package e.g. for comma version 1.2.3 for ubuntu 20.04 run:

> ./comma-apt-docker-build 20.04 1 2 3

if your comma reposity is not in ~/src/comma, but e.g. in ~/my/src/comma, run:

> ./comma-apt-docker-run 20.04 1 2 3 ~/my/src/comma

debian package will be built in your current directory
