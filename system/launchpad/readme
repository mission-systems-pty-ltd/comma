uploading to launchpad

- update comma/debian/changelog; see https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#debian-changelog-debian-changelog
  - ubuntu version (currently jammy)
  - version, e.g. 1.2.3
  - changes
  - date
- update default version in comma/CMakeLists.txt
- run:
      cd ~/src/comma
      git tag -a 1.2.3 -m 'your comments for version 1.2.3'
      cd ..
      comma/system/launchpad/comma-launchpad-upload update 1.2.3
- once build in launchpad succeeds, commit and push
- if there were changes in comma/python, release them into pypi (todo)
- notify interested parties

verifying ppa in docker

uploading to pypi (i know, wrong place; todo: script)

cd comma/python
# version.py: bump up version
# setup.py: uncomment install_requires (commented since it messes installation for those who use apt to install python3 packages (e.g. numpy)
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload --repository-url https://pypi.org/legacy/ dist/* # test
twine upload dist/*

update of 20240205
- pypi requires 2FA now (set e.g. with google authenticator on a mobile)
- legacy twine upload dist/* does not work: 
    HTTPError: 403 Forbidden from https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
    Username/Password authentication is no longer supported. Migrate to API Tokens or Trusted Publishers instead. See https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken and https://pypi.org/help/#trusted-publishers
- follow instructions in the link above to set up api token and rc file (which are really vague: e.g. it seems that PROJECT_NAME should be left as is, NOT replaced with comma-py)
- then run: twine upload --repository PROJECT_NAME dist/* or twine upload dist/*
- it may exit with a very obscure HTTP error 403 or 400, but it seems to upload the repo nevertheless...

todo
  - document
    - uploading to launchpad
    - verifying in docker
      add-apt-repository ppa:orthographic/ppa
      apt-get update
      add-apt-repository multiverse
      apt-get update
      apt-get install comma

  - move docker out of system/package/cpack (can symlink it back)
