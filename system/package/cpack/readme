These scripts can be used to create .deb packages for comma. The building is
done inside a docker container to ensure a consistent build environment and
allow building for different Ubuntu versions.

Build a docker image based on e.g. Ubuntu 20.04, that has all the necessary
tools/libraries installed:
> ./comma-package-docker-build 20.04   # Ubuntu 20.04

Build deb package (e.g. comma version 1.2.3 for Ubuntu 20.04):
> ./comma-package-docker-run 20.04 1.2.3

If your comma reposity is not in ~/src/comma, but e.g. in ~/my/src/comma, run
(you also need to specify comma directory if you run as sudo, since default
location is ~):
> ./comma-package-docker-run 20.04 1.2.3 ~/my/src/comma

Debian package will be built in your current directory

Test that package is ok, e.g:
> ./comma-package-docker-test 20.04 comma-1.2.3-ubuntu-20.04.deb

Sign packages, e.g:
> debsigs --sign=origin -k 79BF9724F37751A39B08698DB3CB85AF5FB6E9F1 comma-1.0.0-ubuntu-20.04.deb
